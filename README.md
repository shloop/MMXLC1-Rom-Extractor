# MMXLC1-Rom-Extractor
I forked this repo to add support for the rev. 1 versions of Mega Man X and Rockman X which were also contained in the game code, but I have since abandoned this in favor of [game-extraction-toolbox](https://github.com/shawngmc/game-extraction-toolbox) which supports many other games.
